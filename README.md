Whole genome sequence (WGS) data analysis pipeline

It inclues sequence quality checking, quality control, taxonomy assignment, assembly, assembly quality assessment, assembled contig annotation, antimicrobial resistance, and taxonomy prediciton.
The pipeline is built using Nextflow, a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. 
It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.
