## Whole genome sequence (WGS) data analysis pipeline

WGS Analysis pipeline includes sequence quality checking, quality control, taxonomy assignment, assembly, assembly quality assessment, assembled contig annotation, antimicrobial resistance, and taxonomy prediciton.
The pipeline is built using Nextflow, a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. 
It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

## Poultry manure bacterial isolates

Comprehending the existence of Antimicrobial Resistant Genes (ARGs) in poultry litter and bacteria harbouring them may provide insights into the potentiality of gene transmission into microbial communities of humans and opportunistic pathogens, highlighting the significance of a One-Health approach that considers the intricate relationships between humans, animals, and environmental health. The outcomes provide insights into the interaction of genes, phenotypes, and environmental variables in forming AMR profiles in poultry contexts, which has implications for agricultural settings and public health.
